# Zomato-SQL-Project

## Assumptions :
- The process of analyzing data with SQL was time-consuming (though not more so than the time invested in documenting it). Good documentation, comments, and notes really helped when rechecking the results, especially for understanding the context and the thought process applied.
  
- Another insight: a query running successfully does not guarantee correct results. While identifying the most loyal customers for all restaurants (Q9), the user ‘Ankit’ was inadvertently left out of the result set due to a query mistake.
  
- Finally, Chicken wings and Choco lava cake are the most ordered food items together. And I vouch for that!
